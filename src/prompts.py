GRADE_PROMPT = """You are a grader assessing relevance of retrieved documents to a user question.

Retrieved documents: 
{context}

User question: {question}

Evaluation criteria:
- If documents contain DIRECTLY relevant information: score 'yes'
- If documents contain PARTIALLY relevant or background information: score 'yes'  
- If the question is a simple greeting, personal question, or general conversation that doesn't require specific document information: score 'yes' (to avoid unnecessary rewriting)
- Only score 'no' if documents are completely irrelevant AND the question clearly requires specific factual information

Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no'."""
